# final_project_TSP
This is a repository containing Fall2021 CAAM471/571 student's code for the final project on TSP.  
Instructions to run the problem solver:  
1) Make sure to include all test instances files under the same directory with main.py.  
2) Change Line 19 in main.py to different instance names like 'berlin52.txt' for different problems testing.  
3) Run main.py by command $ python3.9 main.py in terminal and see output in the format:  
  end1 end2 weight   
  ...  
  The cost of the best tour is: ...  
  where each line "end1 end2 weight" indicates the step should be taken by our salesman, and he should depart from end1 and arrive at end2 in this step; this step will cost the salesman "weight".
